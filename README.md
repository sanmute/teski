# Teski – Deadline Shamer Dashboard

Teski is a study companion that keeps you accountable for upcoming deadlines. The project combines a FastAPI backend, a Vite + React frontend, and a lightweight service worker to deliver reminders, push notifications, and a playful dashboard featuring Teski the deadline frog.

## Features
- Import calendar data (ICS) and turn events into trackable tasks.
- Surfaced study-pack insights, topic maps, and reminder scheduling.
- Push notification support (VAPID) with a background scheduler that periodically sweeps for new reminders.
- Responsive front end built with shadcn-ui, Tailwind CSS, and TanStack Query.
- Progressive Web App hooks (manifest + service worker) so Teski can be installed or work offline for cached assets.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** FastAPI, SQLModel, APScheduler, SQLite, Python 3.12
- **Frontend:** Vite, React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui components
- **Tooling:** npm, ESLint, Makefile helpers, service worker caching

## Repository Layout
```
backend/        FastAPI application, database models, services, and routers
frontend/       Vite + React client, UI components, assets, service worker
requirements.txt  Python dependencies for the backend
Makefile        Common setup/build/dev commands
```

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- SQLite (bundled with Python, used via `sqlite:///` URL)

## Initial Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your fork or GitHub repo url>
   cd teski
   ```
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv backend/.venv
   source backend/.venv/bin/activate  # Windows: backend\.venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
   ```
   Or run `make setup` to perform the same steps.
4. **Create environment files** (not tracked in Git):
   - `.env` (shared defaults)
     ```env
     APP_NAME=Teski
     API_PREFIX=/api
     DB_FILE=app.db
     ```
   - `.env.backend`
     ```env
     DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///backend/app.db
     SECRET_KEY=<random string>
     ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=60
     VAPID_PRIVATE_PEM="-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----..."
     VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=<matching public key>
     LOG_LEVEL=debug
     ```
   - `.env.frontend`
     ```env
     VITE_API_BASE=/api
     VITE_APP_NAME=Teski
     VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC=<same public key as above>
     ```
   Generate your own VAPID key pair for push notifications or remove push usage until you have keys.

## Running the Project
- **Backend (FastAPI + scheduler):**
  ```bash
  uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --env-file .env.backend --port 8000
  ```
  API docs live at http://localhost:8000/docs once the server is running.

- **Frontend (Vite dev server):**
  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm run dev -- --host localhost --port 5173
  ```
  Visit http://localhost:5173 in the browser. The dev server proxies `/api` calls to the backend.

- **Run both with one command:**
  ```bash
  make dev
  ```
  Uses a background process group to boot both servers (Ctrl+C stops both).

### Text-Based Demo Walkthrough
Follow this guided flow if you need to provide judges a quick demo without deploying anywhere:

1. **Start both services** with `make dev` (see above). Wait until Vite reports the dev URL and Uvicorn logs `Application startup complete`.
2. **Visit the dashboard** at http://localhost:5173. The header should show Teski’s frog logo with the “Deadline Shamer Dashboard” title.
3. **Load sample tasks**:
   - If you want real data, click “Import ICS Calendar” and choose an `.ics` file.
   - Otherwise, enable demo mode from the “Settings” side panel (or leave it on by default if you never imported data). You’ll see example tasks such as “Linear Algebra HW 2” and “Mechanical Engineering Lab Report”.
4. **Trigger reminders** by clicking the ✅ action on a task; the toast confirms the update and the task moves to the completed section. Use the “Undo” button on any completed task to bring it back.
5. **Show backend capability** (optional): run this curl command to seed mock data through the API while the server is running:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tasks/mock-load
   ```
   The response reports how many tasks were inserted; refresh the dashboard to see them.
6. **Highlight integrations** by navigating to the Moodle import card and pointing out the upload flow, or open DevTools → Application → Service Workers to show the registered `service-worker.js`.

These steps give a repeatable local storyline you can narrate while screensharing. Include them in your submission notes if hosts need instructions on how to reproduce the demo.

## Building for Production
- **Frontend bundle:** `cd frontend && npm run build`
- **Compile backend bytecode (optional):** `python -m compileall backend`
- **Static assets:** The service worker (`frontend/public/service-worker.js`) precaches key files and updates with a stale-while-revalidate strategy.

## Data & Seeding
- Default storage is `backend/app.db` (SQLite). Delete the file to reset the database.
- Load mock data via the `/api/tasks/mock-load` POST endpoint; it seeds sample tasks from `backend/seed/tasks.json`.

## Push Notifications
- Teski exposes a VAPID-enabled push route (`backend/routes/push.py`).
- Serve your generated `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` to the client (see `.env.frontend`).
- Chromium may require HTTPS or `localhost` to allow push subscriptions.

## Testing & Linting
- Frontend linting: `cd frontend && npm run lint`
- JavaScript/TypeScript formatting: use your editor or run `eslint` per the Makefile.
- (No formal backend test suite yet; add one under `backend/tests/`).

## Deployment Notes
- Use a production ASGI server (e.g., `uvicorn --workers` behind nginx or `gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`).
- Ensure the service worker and manifest are served from the web root.
- Configure environment variables via your hosting platform—never commit secrets.

## Contributing / Next Steps
- Open issues or pull requests for new integrations, additional reminder rules, or UI polish.
- Consider adding automated tests and CI workflows before deployment.
- Document any institution-specific integrations in `docs/` (create if needed) to share with collaborators.

Happy studying with Teski!
